This code sample is for adding vehicles to a database, web-service style.

Assuming there are IIS 10 and SQL Server Express services available, and of course VS2015,
the only two extra pieces required to make it work are the DB creation snippet and url input string.
The associated files for these are:
  - create_table.sql
  - test_url.txt
  
It's a very simple, to say the least, example of the three main components of a web-enabled application working together.
